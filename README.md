# Graph-Instructed Neural Networks for Sparse Grid-Based Discontinuity Detectors
A full documentation for using the trained discontinuity detectors described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13652 will be available 
soon.

Meanwhile, the _detection_2Dexample_line.py_ and _detection_2Dexample_point.py_ can be executed to see the detectors in action, via 
Algorithm 2 illustrated in the paper.

## Updates and Versions
v 0.1 (2025.02.28): Available trained detectors for 2D and 4D. Examples in 2D.
v 0.0 (2024.01.25): Repository creation.
