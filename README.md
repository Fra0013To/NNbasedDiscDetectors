# Neural Networks for Sparse Grid-Based Discontinuity Detectors
A full documentation for using the trained discontinuity detectors described in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amc.2025.129946 (mainly based on Graph-Instructed Neural Networks) will be available 
soon.

Meanwhile, the _detection_2Dexample_line.py_ and _detection_2Dexample_point.py_ can be executed to see the detectors in action, via 
Algorithm 2 illustrated in the paper.

All the detectors (dimensions n=2,4,6,8) of the paper will be **available soon**, together with improved examples.
